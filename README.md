# Simple Physics

A simple project to simulate a 2d physics engine.

Written in a way that any .net project can implement this library(Demo is in WPF).

Written following the rules of SOLID, in a way that is abstract and simplifies developer experience, developers only need to inherit from the library “shapes” and implement a few functions and properties and they are good to go.

- Example is included in the solution.
